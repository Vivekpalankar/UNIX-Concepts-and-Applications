## Notes

-   Type `cd -` is a handy shortcut to switch to the last accessed directory.

-   UNIX file system is case sensitive. However, the default installation of macOS operating system uses a case insensitive HFS file system and hence disallows creating files having same name with differing case.

-   In macOS, if a file or directory has extended attributes, the permissions field printed by the `ls -l` command is followed by a '@' character.  Otherwise, if the file or directory has extended security information (such as an access control list), the permissions field is followed by a '+' character.

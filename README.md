## README

The goal of this project is to compile solutions for *Flex Your Brain* exercises appearing at the end of each chapter in the book *[UNIX Concepts and Applications - Fourth Edition][Book_URL]*, `ISBN-13: 978-0-07-063546-3`. The book is authored by Sumitabha Das and published by [Tata McGraw Hill][Publisher_URL] India.

The questions covered are slightly involved and the answers are not provided by the author. Since the book is generally read by UNIX and GNU/Linux newbies, the solution is meant for validation and reference. Optional notes and any errata found will also be included.

The solution and notes are based on my understanding of questions and the choice of UNIX implementation. The exercises are solved on a computer running [macOS 10.12 Sierra][macOS_URL]. Since many students may be using GNU/Linux, the exercises are also solved on a computer running [Ubuntu Desktop Linux 16.04 LTS][Ubuntu_URL]. If a different solution exists between the two systems, both of them are covered. I will duly mention any special notes and exceptions wherever applicable.

I will make every effort to ensure that the information provided is correct and complete, but cannot provide any kind of guarantee. Please refer to your platform specific manual(s) before running any command or program. Any corrections or contributions are most welcome.

The publisher agreement explicitely prohibits reproduction and distribution of any part of the book in any form or by any means. No copyright infringment is intended and all rights belong where they are due.

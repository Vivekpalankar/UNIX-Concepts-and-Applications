The goal of this project is to compile solutions for **Flex Your Brain** exercises appearing at the end of each chapter in the book [UNIX Concepts and Applications - Fourth Edition][Book], `ISBN-13: 978-0-07-063546-3`. The book is authored by Sumitabha Das and published by [Tata McGraw Hill][Publisher] India.

The questions covered in the exercise are slightly involved and the answers are not provided by the author. The book is generally read by UNIX and GNU/Linux newbies, thus the solution will provide helpful reference. Optional notes and any errata found will also be included.

Certain answer may vary based on understanding of the question and the choice of UNIX implementation. The exercises are solved on computers running [macOS 10.12 Sierra][macOS] and [Ubuntu Desktop Linux 16.10][Ubuntu]. A varying solution, if it exists, will be mentioned. Any special notes and exceptions wherever applicable will be noted.

Every effort will be made to ensure that the information provided is correct and complete. Referring to platform specific manual(s) before running any command or program is recommended.

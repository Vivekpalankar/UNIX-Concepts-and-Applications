## README

The goal of this project is to compile solution for **Flex Your Brain** exercises appearing at the end of each chapter in the book [UNIX Concepts and Applications - Fourth Edition][Book], `ISBN-13: 978-0-07-063546-3`. The book is authored by Sumitabha Das and published by [Tata McGraw Hill India][Publisher].

The questions covered under **Flex Your Brain** exercises are slightly involved and answers for the same are not provided in the book. The book is recommended reading and quite popular among college students who are UNIX and GNU/Linux newbies. Hence, the solution could be a helpful study aid. Optional notes and any errata found will be included.

Some of the answer may vary depending on the interpretation of question and/or system-specific features. The exercises are solved on computers running latest public release of [macOS][macOS] and [Ubuntu Desktop Linux][Ubuntu], both running latest version of [GNU Bash Shell][Bash]. A varying solution, if it exists, will be covered. Any special notes and exceptions wherever applicable will also be noted.

Every effort will be made to ensure that the information provided is correct and complete. Referring to platform specific manual(s) or documentations before running any command or program is highly recommended.

The publisher agreement explicitly prohibits reproduction and distribution of any part of the book in any form or by any means. This project is meant to be an academic exercise with no intension of infringing any copyright.

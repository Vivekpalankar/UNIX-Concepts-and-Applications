01. How will you use **pr**, **sort** and **cut** to read a file in reverse?

    


02. Write a Korn or Bash shell alias that always brings up the last modified file for editing with **vi**.

    


03. How do you select from a file (i) lines 5 to 10, (ii) last but one line?

    


04. How do you display the **date** output with each field on a separate line? How do you now join the fields to get back the original output?

    


05. How do you display a list of all processes without the **ps** header line where processes with the same name are grouped together?

    


06. How will you find out the number of times the character `?` occurs in a file?

    


07. Extract the names of the users from /etc/passwd after ignoring the first 10 entries.

    


08. How do you display a listing of all directories in the PATH list?

    


09. Devise a **sort** command to order the file /etc/passwd on GID (primary) and UID (secondary) so that users with the same GID are placed together. Users with a lower UID should be placed higher in the list.

    


10. Devise a pipeline which lists the five largest files in the current directory.

    


11. Use a pipeline and command substitution to set the length of a line in emp.lst to a variable.

    


12. You have two files, foo1 and foo2, copied from two /etc/passwd files on two machines. How do you print a list of users who are (i) present in foo1 but not foo2, (ii) present in foo2 and not in foo1, (iii) present in both files?

    


13. Assuming that a user may be logged in more than once, how do you (i) list only those users, (ii) mail root a sorted list of all users currently logged in, where a user is mailed only once?

    


14. How are these two commands similar and different? **sort -u foo ; uniq foo**

    


15. A feature provided in a user's startup file appends the output of the **date** command to a file foo whenever a user logs in. How can the user print a report showing the day along with the number of times she logged in on that day?
